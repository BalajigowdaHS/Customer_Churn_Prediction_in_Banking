# Customer Churn Prediction in Banking
## Project Overview
This project aims to address the challenge of customer churn in the competitive banking landscape by leveraging predictive analytics. Our goal is to develop models that forecast the likelihood of customers leaving the bank and implement targeted retention strategies to safeguard revenue streams and enhance long-term profitability.

## Business Understanding
**Business Problem:** Customer churn poses a significant challenge in the banking industry, leading to loss of revenue generated from lending and financial transactions. Identifying potential churn indicators and implementing preemptive measures is essential to mitigate these risks and maintain a sustainable business model.

**Managerial Decisions:** We propose leveraging predictive analysis techniques to forecast customer churn. By analyzing historical banking data, we aim to develop models that identify high-risk customers early and implement targeted retention strategies, such as personalized engagement, loyalty programs, and tailored incentives.

## Objective
Utilize predictive analytics to forecast customer churn, identify high-risk customers early, and implement targeted retention strategies to safeguard revenue and enhance profitability.

### Dataset
**Source:** Kaggle
**Description:** The dataset contains 10,000 observations and 12 variables related to customer demographics, account information, and transaction history.
## Methodology

**Data Preprocessing and Analysis:**

Handled missing values and converted categorical variables to numerical.
Conducted feature selection using correlation analysis.

**Model Development:**

Implemented Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost models.
Evaluated models using precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
Selected XGBoost for its superior accuracy and high AUC (0.84).

**Results:**

Enhanced customer retention strategies led to a $1.98 million increase in quarterly revenue.
Demonstrated the effectiveness of machine learning in reducing false positives and accurately identifying at-risk customers.

**Recommendations:**

Personalized retention strategies including targeted incentives, referral programs, and fee waivers to improve customer loyalty and reduce churn.
